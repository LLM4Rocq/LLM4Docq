You are an expert user of a retrieval system for the Coq proof assistant. Your task is to simulate a realistic query that a mathematician would make when they are stuck in the middle of a proof and looking for a relevant lemma.

Here is the formal statement being proved:

{statement}

Here is the partial proof up to the current point:

{steps}

At this point, the next step in the proof uses this result: {fullname} (you do NOT know this lemma by name)
The next step is: {next_step}

To help you, here are some example docstrings available in the retrieval system:

    "A definition that returns the domain D associated to a group action, representing the set of group elements allowed to act via the action."

    "A lemma stating that for a group action, the function is injective with respect to its first argument, which ensures that the action does not map distinct elements to the same image."

    "A notation that represents the type of a group action for a group of type aT acting on a type T, assuming the action is defined everywhere on the group."

    "A theorem connecting the exponentiation of a root of unity at its order to one, showing that raising the root to its order yields the identity element."

Your task:
Write a realistic search query (in natural language) that you would enter in a retrieval system to try to find a result like {fullname}, given only the information above and not knowing the name of the lemma. Your query should be as if you are actually searching for a result that could help you proceed with the proof.

Example queries you might write:

    "injectivity of group actions"

    "commutativity of addition in natural numbers"

    "identity element for multiplication in ring"

Important:

    Your query should describe what you are looking for or hoping to find, not the statement or docstring of any particular result.

    Do not use the name or statement of any specific lemma; imagine you do not know them.

    Make your query short and focused, as if you are searching a database for relevant results.

    It should exclusively be in natural language.
