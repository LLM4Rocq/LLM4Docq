Tree Structures and Generic Operations in Coq

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose and Goal
================

This file provides a generic formalization of finite rooted trees and parametric tree structures in the Coq proof assistant using the Mathematical Components (MathComp) library. Its primary goal is to define data types for trees and parameterized trees, along with reusable structural recursion schemes and standard traversal, search, and folding algorithms. These abstractions allow for the succinct formal development and reasoning about algorithms that act on trees, such as searching for elements, applying properties to all nodes, mapping, or accumulating results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mathematical Objects and Their Representation
============================================

1. **Finite Rooted Trees**

   The simplest form of a (multi-way) tree is modeled by the inductive type `tree`. In this representation:

   - **tree**: Each tree node (of type `tree`) contains a list (sequence) of zero or more child trees. The definition is recursive, allowing for trees of arbitrary (but finite) shape and branching factor.
      - In Coq: `Inductive tree := Node {{ children : seq tree }}.`
      - Here, `seq` is MathComp's type for finite sequences (lists).

   This model supports unlabeled trees. All structural recursion and operations on trees work with this basic shape.

2. **Parameterized Trees (ptree)**

   To allow trees to store data or labels of arbitrary type, a generic structure called `ptree` is introduced. It is parametrized by a type `T` of labels:

   - **ptree T**: Each node is either a
     - `singleton` leaf node holding a value of type `T`, or
     - `branch` (internal node) holding a finite list of `ptree T` subtrees.
   - In Coq: `Inductive ptree (T : Type) := singleton of T | branch of list (ptree T).`

   This is essentially the structure known as a "rose tree" or "multiway tree," parameterized by the type of labels stored at the leaves.

3. **Boolean and Recursion Operators**

   Several fundamental recursive functions are provided for working over `ptree` types (some could be restricted to `tree` as a special case):

   - **tree_has**: A predicate combinator. Checks whether at least one node in the tree satisfies a provided predicate on type `T`. Modeled like the standard "exists" or "any" operation on tree structures.

   - **tree_all**: Checks whether all nodes in the tree satisfy a given predicate. Modeled like "forall" or "every" over the tree.

   - **tree_foldr**: Right-fold operation. Accumulates a result from the tree, starting from the leaves, combining each value with an accumulator using a provided function.
   
   - **tree_foldl**: Left-fold operation. Traverses the tree, accumulating values using a binary operation in left-to-right order, akin to standard left folds on lists.
   
   These are general schemes for defining computations over trees and are parameterized by type, predicate, or combining functions as needed.

   - **traverse_id**: Maps the identity function over a `tree`, producing a copy. Primarily an example of structural recursion/mapping on the simple `tree` type.

   - **eq_tree**: Checks whether two trees have the same shape by comparing their lists of children recursively using the standard equality (`all2`) on sequences.

4. **Auxiliary and Helper Constructs**

   - **all2**: A standard "pairwise" predicate on lists (here, used for comparing tree children).
   - **has**, **all**, **map**, **foldr**, **foldl**: These are MathComp's standard sequence operations (respectively: "any," "forall," mapping, right fold, left fold), reused in recursive schemes over trees.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Notational and Coding Conventions
=====================================

1. **Implicit Arguments**: The file uses Coq's `Set Implicit Arguments`, meaning that type arguments (such as the element type of sequences or parameter type for `ptree`) are omitted when they can be inferred, reducing verbosity.

2. **Structural Recursion**: Recursive functions operate on the structure of the tree. Patterns distinguish between leaves (`singleton`) and branches for `ptree`, and between nodes for `tree`.

3. **Boolean-valued Predicates**: Following MathComp conventions, properties over trees (e.g., for search or universal quantification) return `bool` rather than `Prop`, supporting reflection and computable reasoning.

4. **Parametricity**: Nearly all functions on `ptree` are parametrized on the label type `T` and (where needed) the result or accumulator type, enhancing genericity and code reuse.

5. **Naming Schemes**:
    - Functions acting on trees are prefixed by `tree_` (e.g., `tree_has`, `tree_all`, `tree_foldr`, `tree_foldl`) to indicate their domain of action.
    - Inductives and constructors are named to distinguish between unlabeled (`tree`) and labeled/parameterized (`ptree`) trees.

6. **List/Sequence Types**: The code uses MathComp's `seq` for finite sequences (which behave the same as standard Coq lists in most contexts), and Coq's standard `list` type in `ptree`; this could be a conscious decision to demonstrate both.

7. **Module Scope**: `From mathcomp Require Import all_boot.` ensures that all foundational MathComp modules (for finite types, sequences, etc.) are available.

8. **Defensive Printing Options**: The settings `Unset Strict Implicit.` and `Unset Printing Implicit Defensive.` adjust how Coq displays type information and implicit declarations, aiding in readability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Context of Use and Interpretation
=================================

This file establishes the fundamental types and recursive processing schemes for trees in a generic and reusable manner, supporting:

- The definition and manipulation of arbitrary trees and labeled trees as mathematical objects.
- Computation over trees (search, mapping, folding) using higher-order functions compatible with standard list/sequence tooling from MathComp.
- Reflection between propositions and boolean computations for tree predicates.
- Extension by other modules—users can employ these tree definitions and recursion principles to specify or prove correctness of tree algorithms, define tree traversals, or express recursive properties needed in mathematical or program verification tasks.

All code follows a MathComp-inspired style: preference for `bool`-valued predicates and computational content, type-parameterized interfaces, and systematic structural recursion. No specific tree invariants (e.g., balancing) are assumed—these are minimal foundations upon which more specialized tree machinery could be built.

Here is a Coq source file from the mathcomp library:

"{source}"

I need you to help me write all the docstring.

To do it, write a json corresponding to a list of all docstring, in the format:

[{{"fullname": "Definition trunc x := if 0 <= x then sval (trunc_subproof x) else 0%N.", "docstring": "The function trunc returns the greatest natural number less than or equal to x when x is at least zero by using the constructive truncation proof; otherwise it returns zero."}}, ....

More precisely, I want you do it for the following:

{missing}

Here are the guidelines to write the docstrings:

Follow these rules when writing “docstring”:

1.  **Natural language only.**  Do not use any mathematical symbols (like <, ≤, =, etc.).  
2.  **Complete sentences.**  Write at least one full sentence; use clear subject-verb-object structure.  
3.  **Explicit**.  Spell out operations and relationships in plain English (e.g. “less than” instead of “<”).  
4.  **Self-contained.**  Anyone reading just the docstring should understand what the lemma does without needing to see Coq syntax or names.  
5.  **Embedding-friendly.**  Avoid pronouns or references that need extra context (e.g. “this” or “it”); mention the inputs and outputs by name or role.  
6.  **Don't cite the name of the premise in the docstring**.

Here is some examples of good docstrings:

"A lemma stating that in a finite field F, the number of invertible elements equals the total number of elements in F minus one, since exactly the zero element is not invertible."
"A notation introducing {{unit R}} to denote the group of invertible elements of a ring R, enabling implicit conversion between units and ring elements as a subtype."
"A lemma stating that multiplication operation on the ring of integers modulo p is commutative."
"A notation denoting the type of integers modulo the maximum of p and two."
"A factory record asserting that a subset of a unital algebra contains zero and one, is closed under subtraction, multiplication, taking inverses of units, and scalar multiplication, thus forming a division-closed subalgebra."

Your final json must be contains in a json code block.
